## Personal Projects
This repository is a collection of small projects. These projects are meant to demonstrate what I can do.

## List of Projects
- Image Compression. This project demonstrates how images can be compressed using SVD and thresholding.  
   - Image Recovery.pdf contains images and explanation.
   - Image Recovery.R contains code and custom functions for simplifying the process.
     -Future project will focus on improving image resolution with "noisy" images.

- Survival Analysis.
   - survival_cirrhosis.pdf is a print out of the Rmd file.
   - survival_cirrhosis.Rmd contains the R markdown file.
   - survival_cirrhosis.R same code as the Rmd, but in a basic R format.


## Other Projects
- MMPIO contributions
   - https://github.com/zfuller7/mmpio
   - forked from an existing project and written in GO.
- Ledoit/Wolf Covariance shrinkage
  - The project I forked this from was written in Python.
  - I developed my R script independently of the python script, but decided not to create a totally new repository.
-Quantile Regression with Splines
   - https://github.com/zfuller7/quantreg
   - Shiny App for demonstrating the effect of the smoothing parameter on a spline in Quantile Regression.
